Although we hire many high school-college age students, we encourage youth leaders, and individuals currently in an education field (Coaches, Teachers, etc) to apply as well. Due to the seasonality of a lifeguard position, many individuals find working for USA Management during the summer beneficial while working in education. Available positions include aquatic director, pool manager, lifeguards, concessions, admissions, and swim instructors. We offer full and part time hours, excellent wages (up to $15 an hour), and flexible schedules."
